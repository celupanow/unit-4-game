// The player must choose a character - there are four options. Then the player must choose an opponent from the remaining options.

// Possibly it would make sense to create an object for each character?

// var Person1 {
// 	name: Joe Schmoe;
// 	picture: ??;
// 	health-points: 150;
// 	attack-power: 60;
// 	counter-attack-power: 20;
// };

// Like this maybe? Do this for each character.

// So then there will be an onclick event for the player to choose their fighter.
// After which, the rest of the characters become enemies and move to a different part of the screen.
// Then another onclick event for the player to choose their opponent, which moves them to a defender area.
// Then there will be an attack button.
// Attack button: enemy loses hp, then instantly counterattacks, causing player to lose some hp.
// Defender gets to zero, player chooses a new opponent.
// if the player gets to zero, they lose, if they defeat all enemies, they win
